Glav.in
=======

The goal of Glav.in is to provide the simplest CMS experience possible. It is **not** intended for large, multifaceted websites - it just ain't got the juice. Glav.in is for simple, informational websites.

Features
========

* Super simple to install.
* No database. All data is stored in JSON files.
* User Management (3 Levels: Owner, Admin, Contributor)
* Easy templating & support for multiple layouts
* With Gunt Glav.in is now:
 - concatening and minimising the css files into template/build/production.min.css
 - concatening and minimising the js files into template/build/production.min.js
 - using livereload to develop front-end code

* It's named after a catchphrase of a character from The Simpsons.
